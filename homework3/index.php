    <p>Major League Baseball, the National Football League, and the National Basketball Association are the three largest professional sports leagues in the United States. They are the three largest sports leagues in the world by revenue, and field players from all around the world. Every block of competition is broken into an annual season where one champion is crowned out of all competitors. For the three leagues, seasons vary greatly in terms of games played. The NFL, for instance, only plays 16 games per season per team, while the NBA plays 82, and the MLB plays 162 games per season per team. At the end of each season, the leagues culminate in a playoff where the best teams compete for that season's championshop title.</p>

		A national park is a park in use for conservation purposes. Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride. An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA), has defined "National Park" as its Category II type of protected areas.

		The United States has many National Parks -- areas set aside for preservation, often for their natural beauty. These areas make popular tourist attractions, both for their historical value and for their hiking and camping attractions. I've been lucky enough to visit a few national parks, some of them are listed below.
